🐍 Snake Game – Classic Arcade Fun Reimagined!
🎮 Welcome to Snake Game! A modern twist on the timeless arcade classic where you control a hungry snake, gobbling up food while avoiding collisions! Can you master the grid and grow endlessly? Let’s find out! 🚀

🌟 How the Game Works?
🎯 Objective:
Control the slithering snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself!

🕹️ Gameplay Mechanics
🎮 Snake Movement:
🔹 The snake moves continuously in the last set direction.
🔹 Use arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to change direction.
🔹 The snake wraps around the edges—exit one side and appear on the opposite side!

🍎 Eating Food:
🔹 Randomly appearing dark blue food items – Eat them to grow!
🔹 Each bite adds a new segment to the snake’s body.
🔹 More food = Longer snake = Higher score!

🏆 Scoring & Growth:
🔹 Each food item eaten = Score boost!
🔹 The game speeds up as your snake grows! Think fast, react faster!

☠ Game Over Conditions:
❌ Collision with self – If the snake bites its own tail, game over!
❌ (Optional) Boundary Crash – If enabled, hitting a wall ends the game.
✅ Classic Wrap Mode – Snake moves off one edge and reappears on the opposite side.

🎨 Visuals & Features
✨ Sleek Color Scheme:
🐍 Snake: Light Yellow (Stands out against the grid!)
🍎 Food: Dark Blue (Easy to spot!)

🖥️ User Interaction:
✅ Real-time response to player input.
✅ Smooth animations with fluid movements.
✅ Endless gameplay – Keep playing and beat your high score!

🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Difficulty Levels – Increase speed dynamically for a tougher challenge!
🔹 Obstacles & Hazards – Dodge walls, barriers, or moving enemies!
🔹 Multiplayer Mode – Compete with friends on the same screen!
🔹 Leaderboard System – Track your best scores and challenge others!
